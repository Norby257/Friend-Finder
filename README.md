# Hob-baes 

# Hob-baes is a dating application. 

Our goal is to help you meet people. Whether you are watching Netflix, or watching the sunset, our sophisticated algorithim  will find you matches! 

# Our motto: Shared hobbies first.

##  Why we're different 

 We love the swipe right, swipe left functionality of dating apps. What we'd enjoy even more is an app that emphasizes hobbies and connections more so than photos. This is why we do the survey _before_ the photos. There's a story behind the face. 
 
 We believe in using our tech powers for good, and helping our target audience (users aged 25-35) make connections based on shared hobbies and interests. In today's fast paced, high-tech world, it can be tricky to find friends, meet people etc. We believe in having an inclusive audience. 


####    Research shows that social media usage can cause people to feel lonley, anxious, or left out; these are commonly referred to as fear of missing out (FOMO) and we all know fake news can cause anxiety too. 

#####   A study by the University of Pittsburgh asserts that there is a positive correlation between spending time on social media and feeling lonely. http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/social-media-high-usage-more-isolated-lonely-people-study-university-pittsburgh-a7614226.html

#### So, we'd like people to use our app and meet in real life and not be lonely.


#### This app was inspired by:
* Millenials
* Technology 

## Future developments 

#### We are constantly improving so that our users have an enjoyable experience both on this app and in real life. Some of our next goals include:
* Suggesting events based on geo-location, current weather, and answers to survey questions 
* Providing map locations for suggested events 
* Ice-breakers so that meeting In real life  is not awkward 
* The option of 'group hang' which is like meetup but cooler
* Including LGBT audience and spaces
